# CapitolAI Project teams

## Overview

The Project team structure is a new approach to feature development and project management at CapitolAI. This system assigns responsibility for specific features to senior team members, who then lead cross-functional teams to build these features. E.g. Projects will be lead by Masha, who then is responsible for project management of that project including coordinating communications, defining deadlines, creating and tracking tickets in github, maintaining project board, and reporting on progress. The goal is to enhance ownership, accountability, and cross-functional collaboration while maintaining dev roles.

## Benefits

1. Rotating Leadership: Team members take turns leading projects while maintaining their IC roles.
2. Cross-Functional Collaboration: Project Owners build and lead teams across different specialties (frontend, backend, data).
3. Accountability: Project Owners are responsible for feature delivery within set deadlines.
4. Personal Investment: By leading a project, team members become personally invested in its success.

## Responsibilities of Project Owners. Order of Opperations:

1. Design / Product Consensus: Comprehend agreed-upon designs and clarify all feature aspects with product/design teams before kickoff.
2. Kickoff Meeting: Organize and lead a kickoff meeting, inviting relevant engineering staff.
3. Team Formation: Collaborate with team leads (frontend, backend, data) to select team members for the feature.
4. Project Planning: Develop a comprehensive plan including interfaces, contracts, roadmap, and deadlines.
5. Task Management: Create a GitHub project board and generate necessary tickets.
6. Reporting: Provide weekly project status reports.
7. Team Coordination: Organize project standups at least every other day.
