# CapitolAI Project Owner Scheme

## Overview

The Project Owner Scheme is a new approach to feature development and project management at CapitolAI. This system assigns responsibility for specific features to senior team 
members, who then lead cross-functional teams to build these features. The goal is to enhance ownership, accountability, and cross-functional collaboration while maintaining 
individual contributor (IC) roles.

## Eligibility

- Only CapitolAI team members with at least 6 months of tenure are eligible to be Project Owners.

## Key Principles

1. Rotating Leadership: Team members take turns leading projects while maintaining their IC roles.
2. Cross-Functional Collaboration: Project Owners build and lead teams across different specialties (frontend, backend, data, etc.).
3. Accountability: Project Owners are responsible for feature delivery within set deadlines.
4. Personal Investment: By leading a project, team members become personally invested in its success.

## Responsibilities of Project Owners

1. Design Understanding: Comprehend agreed-upon designs and clarify all feature aspects with product/design teams.
2. Kickoff Meeting: Organize and lead a kickoff meeting, inviting relevant engineering staff.
3. Team Formation: Collaborate with team leads (frontend, backend, data) to select team members for the feature.
4. Project Planning: Develop a comprehensive plan including interfaces, contracts, roadmap, and deadlines.
5. Task Management: Create a GitHub project board and generate necessary tickets.
6. Reporting: Provide weekly project status reports.
7. Team Coordination: Organize project standups at least every other day.

## Benefits

- Develops project management skills across the senior team
- Encourages personal investment in feature success
- Promotes cross-functional collaboration and understanding
- Potentially leads to faster decision-making and issue resolution
- Provides senior ICs with a broader perspective on the development process

## Potential Challenges and Mitigations

1. Workload Balance: Ensure Project Owner responsibilities don't negatively impact primary IC roles.
   Mitigation: Regular workload reviews and adjustments as needed.

2. Consistent Practices: Maintain consistency in project management across different Project Owners.
   Mitigation: Establish standardized tools, processes, and best practices.

3. Knowledge Transfer: Ensure learnings and insights are shared across the team.
   Mitigation: Implement a knowledge sharing system and regular retrospectives.

4. Junior Team Member Development: Provide growth opportunities for team members with less than 6 months tenure.
   Mitigation: Create a mentorship program where Project Owners guide junior team members.

## Implementation Strategy

1. Pilot Phase: Start with a small number of projects to test and refine the approach.
2. Training: Provide project management training to all eligible team members.
3. Support Structure: Establish a support system for Project Owners to seek advice when needed.
4. Regular Review: Conduct periodic reviews of the scheme, adjusting based on feedback and outcomes.
5. Transition Planning: Develop clear plans for transitioning team members into Project Owner roles as they reach eligibility.

## Conclusion

The Project Owner Scheme aims to leverage the expertise of our senior team members while fostering a culture of shared responsibility and cross-functional collaboration. By rotating 
project leadership among our experienced ICs, we expect to see increased engagement, more efficient feature delivery, and the development of well-rounded engineering leaders within 
CapitolAI.
